# AssemblyInterpreter
A simple assembly interpreter for a 5-stage pipeline CPU with data cache

In this class project I developed an assembly interpreter that accepts instructions and outputs various statistics about the execution of the program - # of instructions executed, # of cycles, # of cache misses. The program simulates a CPU with 32 registers and also memory locations. The CPU implements data cache with 256 positions, direct-mapped, write-back and write-allocate. 

The project was developed for CSC7080 (Computer Architecture).
